            "description": "Split across three hilarious Tall Tales packed with secrets and side-quests, Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island invites pirates to meet classic characters, in a new narrative that brings the iconic locations of Monkey Island to the Sea of Thieves.\n\nThe adventure begins on M√™l√©e Island, where pirates can take in the sights, smells and roguish splendour of the island as they seek to uncover why everyone suddenly seems to think quite highly of self-proclaimed mighty pirate, and known poodle pacifier, Guybrush Threepwood. Something's quite clearly wrong...\n\nThis love-letter to the classic adventure game series will be available to play alone or with a crew, with three Tall Tales being added over three months as free updates for all players, starting July 20th.\n\nMore info for mighty pirates: https://aka.ms/LoMI_Announcement\n\nLearn more about Sea of Thieves: https://www.seaofthieves.com/\n\nSea of Thieves Merch: https://www.raregames.store/sea-of-thieves\nBuy the game and forge your own legend: https://www.xbox.com/seaofthieves \nDive into the Sea of Thieves Forums: https://www.seaofthieves.com/forum \nFollow Sea of Thieves on Twitter: https://aka.ms/SoTTwitter \nLive your best pirate's life with us on TikTok: https://aka.ms/SoTTikTok\nWatch live Sea of Thieves piracy on Twitch: https://aka.ms/SoTTwitch\nSoak up Sea of Thieves sunsets on Instagram: https://aka.ms/SoTInsta\nLike Sea of Thieves on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SeaOfThievesGame\nTalk Sea of Thieves on Discord: https://aka.ms/SoTDiscord\nFor anything else, go to: https://www.seaofthieves.com/\n\nXbox Live Gold required to play on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S (sold separately)."
